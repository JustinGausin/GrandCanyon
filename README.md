# GrandCanyon
The project was created for CS361-Data Structures and Algorithm at ODU for Spring 2019. 

## Specifics
A specific type of Grand Canyon was built using ridges, cliffs, a river, and other structures. Next, a triangulation refinement (Deulaunay refinement) was carried out on the canyon structure. A randomize "paraglider" lands on one of the triangular mesh and finds the shortest (&safest) path down the canyon using Dijkstra's algorithm.


## Bug
Due to the very limited time in finishing the Dijkstra's algorithm, it does not work as intended most of the time.
